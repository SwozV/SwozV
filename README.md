# Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I’m Swoz 😄

I'm currently a university 🎓 student majoring in Computer Science 💻. I'm passionate about programming and currently learning Golang.

In my free time, I like to work on side projects :hammer: and contribute to open source :octocat:.

I'm always open to connecting with other developers! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project together 🤝 or just chat over coffee ☕.

Let's build something awesome! 🚀
